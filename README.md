Group Project – Car Idea
Purpose:
Friends give each other lifts and log the journeys they make. This makes it easier to agree on fuel and time compensation and makes it easier to plan journeys together. 
The app provides convenience in planning both road trips and commutes between friends sharing a vehicle. 
AA guidelines will be used to calculate compensation based on distance travelled for a fair, standardised method of calculation.
It would also be fun for friends to track and plan their journeys, making the app a more social experience as well.

Giving/receiving a lift to/from a friend
•	Either a rider OR driver creates a group
•	Rider(s) and driver join the group
•	Driver can select a group meet point for riders that are close enough to meet together
•	Rider(s) can also optionally select their own pickup point if they cannot get to the meet point
•	App calculates most efficient route (google maps API). Driver travels the route to the destinations, picking everyone up along the way
•	At the end of the journey, the journey is saved to the group for everyone to look at
